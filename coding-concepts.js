// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
//console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer:
// b) Verify and explain:

const cohort = "LEARN 2022"
console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer:
// I THINK THE ANSWER IS TEN
// b) Verify and explain:
// AFTER THE CONSOLE LOG.... THE ANSWER IS 10.... I NOTICE THE .length PROPERTY ------L E A R N  2 0 2 2---- I COUNTED 10 SPACES... MY GUESS WAS CORRECT

// --------------------2) What will this log?

const greeting = "Hello World!"
console.log(greeting[4])

// a) Your answer:
// I THINK THE ANSWER IS "O"
// b) Verify and explain:
// AFTER THE LOG.... THE ANSWER IS "O" ....[4] IS THE INDEX VALUE --------H E L L O--------- I COUNTED 4 SPACES (STARTING FROM 0)... MY GUESS WAS CORRECT 


// --------------------3) What will this log?

const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
const index = 1
console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer:
// I THINK THE ANSWER IS Ruby
// b) Verify and explain:
// AFTER THE LOG.... THE ANSWER IS Ruby ...."Javascript IS ZERO... "Ruby" IS ONE... "Ruby√ü" IS THE FIRST INDEX FOR THIS LIST OF STRINGS


// --------------------4) What will this log?

const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: I THINK THE ANSWER IS "SATURDAY" "SUNDAY"
// b) Verify and explain:
// AFTER THE LOG.... THE ANSWER IS "TypeError: weekendDays.toUpperCase is not a function"... I AM GOING TO FURTHER RESEARCH HOW TO USE THE UPPER CASE FOR THIS SITUATION

// --------------------5) What will this log?

const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer:
// I THINK THE ANSWER IS "THREE"
// b) Verify and explain:
// AFTER THE LOG.... THE ANSWER IS number.... I WASNT FAMILIAR WITH THE typeof.... I AM GOING TO FURTHER RESEARCH typeof
